# TurboSpeed
 
Welcome to TurboSpeed, a game in which you play as a yellow car trying to avoid other cars. The game starts off with two cars on the road, but as the game progresses, more cars and mines start to appear. Survive for 5 minutes to beat the game. Good luck!

Use the arrow keys to move the car around.

Avoid getting hit by enemy cars or mines, or you will restart the game.
